## üìã Phase 1: Project Discovery and Analysis

### 1.1 Initial Workspace Analysis

```
@workspace Analyze this multi-repository workspace and provide:

1. **Repository Inventory**: List all repositories with their primary purpose and technology stack
2. **Connection Analysis**: Identify technical dependencies, API connections, and data flow between repositories
3. **Architecture Overview**: Describe the overall system architecture and how repositories work together
4. **Documentation Gaps**: Identify what documentation currently exists and what's missing
5. **Recommended Documentation Structure**: Suggest the optimal documentation organization for this project

Format the response as a comprehensive analysis that will guide the documentation generation process.
```

### 1.2 Repository Classification

```
@workspace Classify each repository in this workspace by:
