## 5. ROI Calculation Templates

### Simple ROI Calculator

#### Input Parameters
```
Number of Developers: [X]
Average Developer Salary: $[X]/year
GitHub Copilot Cost: $468/developer/year
Productivity Improvement: 55% (default)
Quality Improvement: 25% (default)
Time Savings: 2 hours/day/developer (default)
```

#### Calculation Formula
```
Annual Investment = Number of Developers × $468
Productivity Gains = Number of Developers × Average Salary × 0.55
Quality Savings = Number of Developers × Average Salary × 0.25 × 0.3
Time Savings Value = Number of Developers × (Average Salary / 2080) × 2 × 260

Total Benefits = Productivity Gains + Quality Savings + Time Savings Value
Net Benefit = Total Benefits - Annual Investment
ROI = (Net Benefit / Annual Investment) × 100%
```

#### Example Calculation (50 developers, $100K average salary)
```
Annual Investment: 50 × $468 = $23,400
Productivity Gains: 50 × $100,000 × 0.55 = $2,750,000
Quality Savings: 50 × $100,000 × 0.25 × 0.3 = $375,000
Time Savings Value: 50 × ($100,000/2080) × 2 × 260 = $1,250,000

Total Benefits: $4,375,000
Net Benefit: $4,375,000 - $23,400 = $4,351,600
ROI: ($4,351,600 / $23,400) × 100% = 18,595%
```

### Advanced ROI Model
