# ⚡ Virtual AI Team Orchestration - Quick Reference Card

> **Keep this open while working** - Essential information at a glance

## 🏗️ WORKSPACE SETUP (Do This First)

**Copy the entire `virtual_ai_team_orchestration/` folder to your project workspace root:**

```
your_project_workspace/
├── virtual_ai_team_orchestration/     ← Copy this framework here
├── project_orchestration_workspace/   ← Will be created during execution
└── your_actual_project_files/          ← Your existing project
```

*Detailed setup: See `📁_FILE_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md`*

## 🚀 EXECUTION CHECKLIST

### Phase 0: Validation (REQUIRED)
- [ ] **Project Analysis**: Use `02_EXECUTION_TEMPLATES/EXEC_prompt_starter_kit.md` → "Project Analysis Prompt"
- [ ] **Foundation Checklist**: Complete the "Critical Foundation Validation Checklist"
- [ ] **GO/NO-GO Decision**: Confirm project is viable before proceeding

### Phase 1: Execution
- [ ] **Master Orchestrator**: Use "Enhanced Master Orchestrator Prompt"
- [ ] **Role Execution**: Follow generated role-specific prompts
- [ ] **Human Feedback**: Integrate approvals at decision points
- [ ] **Iteration**: Continue through all roles

## 🚨 CRITICAL VALIDATION CHECKS

### Before Starting ANY Project
- [ ] **Problem is clearly defined** (not vague)
- [ ] **Solution is technically feasible** (not over-engineered)
- [ ] **Resources are adequate** (time, skills, budget)
- [ ] **Timeline is realistic** (with 50% buffer)
- [ ] **Scope is minimal viable** (not feature-bloated)

### Red Flags - STOP if ANY apply
- [ ] Unproven/bleeding-edge technology for critical features
- [ ] More than 3 external API dependencies
- [ ] Unrealistic timeline pressure
- [ ] Insufficient budget for proper implementation
- [ ] Trying to handle too many roles alone

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Prompts Aren't Working
1. **Check context**: Did you include all required information?
2. **Simplify scope**: Are you trying to do too much?
3. **Validate foundation**: Did you complete Phase 0 properly?
4. **Review examples**: Check `EXEC_dynamic_prompt_examples.md`

### If Getting Overwhelmed
1. **Pause and validate**: Go back to foundation checklist
2. **Simplify scope**: Remove non-essential features
3. **Focus on MVP**: What's the absolute minimum?
4. **Get human help**: Don't try to solve everything alone

### If Results Are Poor Quality
1. **Add more context**: Include more project details
2. **Use negative validation**: What should be avoided?
3. **Iterate with feedback**: Use human feedback integration
4. **Check anti-patterns**: Review what NOT to do

## 💡 SUCCESS TIPS

### Do This
- ✅ **Start with validation** (Phase 0 is critical)
- ✅ **Keep scope minimal** (MVP mindset)
- ✅ **Use simple technology** (proven solutions)
- ✅ **Iterate frequently** (small steps)
- ✅ **Get human feedback** (don't work in isolation)

### Avoid This
- ❌ **Skipping validation** (leads to project failure)
- ❌ **Over-engineering** (complexity kills projects)
- ❌ **Feature creep** (stick to essential features)
- ❌ **Working alone** (get feedback and help)
- ❌ **Perfectionism** (done is better than perfect)
